Le Loop's Door Control System Proof Of Concept

as installed, coded, built and designed by Guyzmo, for Le Loop Hackerspace

Thanks to Clement and all the friends of Le Loop.

COMPILE ME !

To compile this, you shall verify the PATH to the Wire and i2c arduino libraries in the Makefile.
The Makefile has been crafted for a MacOS X installation. It shall be compatible with Linux, but
PATHES will need severe tweaking... Sorry for that.

Please check the IP addresses before sending the code to the Arduino. All are statically addressed.
And check the PINs in the code to match your needs.

The code is not checking the cards, but will open for every MiFare card you can swipe.
To enable checking of the card, comment the "#define YES_DOOR" line at the begining of the code.

HACK ME

This code is a first PoC for the lab, with no security embedded at All. It has been designed
to work with the Ethernet Shield v4. But it works, and if you hack it, please come see us and
have a beer ;)

MUSIC

The Door bell uses some sound samples taken from Mario (the coin and mushrooms ones).

SERVER SIDE CODE

This code depends on bottle.py (easy_install bottle). 
And on ircbot.py (Sean B. Palmer, inamidst.com).
And on pysqlite3.

It connects to an IRC server and a channel in a thread and voices people that enters the door.
It verify who is opening the door against the embedded sqlite3 database.

TODO

 * write the script to add/remove users from the db. (the code is there, just need 
to make a standalone command)
 * improve security and stability

BUGS

Plenty !
Of course, as this is a work in progress...

but the YES DOOR mode seems to work flawlessly.
